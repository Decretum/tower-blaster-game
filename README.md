# tower-blaster-game
A few "AI" strategies and a test framework for a game called Tower Blaster.

Here's a real version of the game that explains the game better than I ever could: http://www.puffgames.com/everywhere/tower_blast.html

Long story short, you need to stack some numbered blocks in order. 

In any case, this project contains some "AI" strategies to play this game as a CPU player, as well as a test framework to see how good each strategy is.

If you have an idea of a strategy for this game, try implementing it and running the test, and let me know how it goes!
